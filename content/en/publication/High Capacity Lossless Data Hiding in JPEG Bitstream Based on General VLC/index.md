abstract: As a branch of reversible data hiding (RDH), lossless data hiding
  (LDH) technique is important especially. Because LDH can not only reconstruct
  the cover image losslessly but also keep the visual quality of the marked
  image no degradation. This paper proposes a new LDH scheme for JPEG images by
  general variable length code (VLC) mapping. In this scheme, the run size
  values are first reordered. Then a feasible solution space is generated. A
  simulated embedding model is established to find the optimal solution from the
  feasible solution space. The optimal mapping relationship is constructed
  according to the optimal solution. According to the optimal GVM relationship,
  the Huffman table in the file header is modified and then the additional data
  can be embedded by replacing the used VLC with the VLCs in the same mapping
  set. Experimental results demonstrate that most of the JPEG images using the
  proposed scheme cause less file size increments than previous RDH schemes
  while keeping the marked JPEG image with no distortion. Furthermore, the
  proposed scheme can obtain high embedding capacity.
