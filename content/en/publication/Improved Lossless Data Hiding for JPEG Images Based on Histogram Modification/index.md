abstract: This paper proposes a lossless and high payload data hiding scheme for JPEG images by histogram modification. The most in JPEG bitstream consists of a sequence of VLCs (variable length codes) and the appended bits. Each VLC has a corresponding RLV (run/length value) to record the AC/DC coefficients. To achieve lossless data hiding with high payload, we shift the histogram of VLCs and modify the DHT segment to embed data. Since we sort the histogram of VLCs in descending order, the filesize expansion is limited. The paperâ€™s key contribution includes Lossless data hiding, less filesize expansion in identical pay-load and higher embedding efficiency.
