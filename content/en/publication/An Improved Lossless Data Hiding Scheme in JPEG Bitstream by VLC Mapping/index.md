abstract: This paper proposed a lossless data hiding scheme by variable length code (VLC) mapping, which focused on embedding additional data into JPEG bitstream. The entropy-coded data in JPEG bitstream consists of a sequence of VLCs and the appended bits. Not all VLCs defined in the JPEG file header are used in the entropy-coded data and the replacement of unused-VLCs do nothing with image decompression. Hence, additional data can be embedded by mapping the unused-VLCs to the used-VLCs. To obtain higher embedding capacity, we improved the mapping rules in this paper. Employing the proposed mapping scheme, larger embedding capacity and no image distortion are both achieved while the filesize of JPEG is preserved after data embedding.
